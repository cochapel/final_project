      <p>Chapel Hill, NC—Although there is no longer a decline in the bee population in the U.S., parasitic mites brought in
      from Indonesia are still threatening their ability to survive.
      <br />
      <br />

      Parasitic mites, known as Varroa mites, were first discovered in Indonesia in the early 1900s, Nancy Ruppert said, an
      apiary inspector for the North Carolina department of agriculture. The parasites were introduced into the U.S. from trade,
      which started in 1987.
      <br />
      <br />

      This is one of the biggest issues that affects colonies, especially when beekeepers aren’t properly taking care of them,
      Ruppert said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “A lot of sources that you might see will say that Varroa mites are the number one problem and that is why bees are dying,
      and that is true,” Ruppert said. “But beekeepers are supposed to know what to do and they don’t do it and that is what
      will kill the bees.”
      <br />
      <br />

      In order to prevent the mites from affecting bee colonies, there are around six different methods used, Ruppert said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “Some of them are natural plant-based chemicals that are put in the hive to kill the mites, but not the bees,” Ruppert
      said. “Some methods are different integrated pest management processes that can be taken.”
      <br />
      <br />

      According to the North Carolina State Extension Publication, an integrated pest management process is taken to make sure
      all approaches to pest control are being taken. This method can also allow certain pests, such as bees, to survive.
      <br />
      <br />

      Another method that people are trying to do is improve the genetics of bees so that they become resistant to the mites,
      Ruppert said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “Over in parts of the world, where these Varroa mites have existed for a while, the bees are resistant,” Ruppert said.
      “So, those bees aren’t dying off as much as the wimpy bees here in this country or other parts of the world.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Only a few areas in the U.S. have noticed an increased resistance to the mites, Ruppert said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “In those locations they have made improvements, but those are by far the minority of bees and beekeepers in this
      country,” Ruppert said.
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked which locations bees are becoming resistant to the mites, Ruppert said. “Well, they are really, really
      scattered.”
      <br />
      <br />

      The reason that most bees haven’t been able to build a resistance to the mites is because the parasites introduction into
      the U.S. is fairly new, Don Hopkins said, another apiary inspector for the North Carolina department of agriculture.
      <br />
      <br />

      “Thirty years might seem like a long time, but it’s not,” Hopkins said. “Keeping the mites from affecting bee colonies has
      been a real fight to keep up with.”
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked how much the mites have affected bee populations, Hopkins said, “quite a bit…it is sort of a main threat to
      honeybee colonies right now in North America.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Another concerning issue that is affecting bee populations is climate change, Steve Frank said, a professor at North
      Carolina State University in entomology and plant pathology. This is because the bee’s ability to reproduce diminishes at
      a certain temperature.
      <br />
      <br />

      According to a study from NCSU, larger species of bees are able to withstand higher temperatures than smaller bees.
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked why larger bees are able to withstand higher temperatures, Frank said, “Well, we don’t know exactly... Except,
      by just being larger, their temperatures are not going to increase as rapidly.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Fortunately, there is hope for reviving the bee population, Hopkins said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “I would go beyond hope. We are on the rebound, it is just that we have these issues to deal with and we just got to
      continue to deal with them,” Hopkins said.
