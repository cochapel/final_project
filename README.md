# final_project

I am working on a project about saving bee populations from declining around the U.S. I intend to make this an informative project that will teach beekeepers how to properly take care of their bee colonies. I also plan to include information about how the general public can help rebound the bee population.

In this project I will provide information about Varroa mites, which are parasitic mites that are the number one issue affecting bee populations. I have interviewed Nancy Ruppert and Don Hopkins, whom are bee inspectors in North Carolina, about Varroa mites and how they are affecting bee populations. I will also include information on how climate change prevents bees from reproducing because of the increasing temperatures from urban warming. I have found a study done by Steve Frank at North Carolina State University that explains how urban warming is able to prevent bees from reproducing.

Ruppert explained to me that certain areas in the U.S. have genetically modified bees to the point they have become resistant to Varroa mites, but this is only the minority of beekeepers and bees in the U.S. I plan to include a map in my project showing these areas so that people can see how sparse this genetic modification has occurred.

For the study done by Frank, I have found data that shows the type of bees being tested and at what temperature they are unable to reproduce. When I interviewed Frank, he mentioned that the size of the bee may have an impact on what temperatures they are affected. I plan to show this comparison using a detailed information graphic.

For providing my audience with more up to date information on beekeeping and news about bees, I will be incorporating a newsfeed from the most active beekeeper associations around the U.S. This should provide my audience with interesting information that could help engage them in the site.
