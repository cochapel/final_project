      <p>Chapel Hill, NC—A recent study found that the chemical glyphosate, which is found in the weed killer called Roundup,
      negatively effectives the digestive system of honey bees and makes them more vulnerable to infections and diseases.
      <br />
      <br />

      According to the study done in the University of Hawaii at Manoa that was published on October 9, 2018, honey bees that
      are exposed to glyphosate experience a decrease in the number of healthy bacteria in their digestive system. There are
      eight different strains of bacteria that are essential to a honey bee in order to promote healthy weight gain and to help
      strengthen their immune system.
      <br />
      <br />

      Since Roundup is a commonly used household weed killer, honey bees are easily exposed to the chemical, Emma Shumway said,
      who is a conservation associate for the Environment North Carolina organization.
      <br />
      <br />

      “What it does is it destroys some of the beneficial bacteria in their gut,” Shumway said. “Without the bacteria, they
      become more susceptible to infection, and a lot of times are actually killed by harmful bacteria.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Shumway said that the chemical doesn’t necessarily kill the honey bees, but it does make them vulnerable to other threats
      that can potentially kill them.
      <br />
      <br />

      According to the study, newly emerged worker bees are nearly free of gut bacteria. The way that they are able to get these
      healthy bacteria into their digestive system is by oral transmission from the older worker bees. The study also suggest
      that glyphosate can prevent newly emerged worker bees from getting a sufficient number of healthy bacteria into their
      digestive system because of the impact it has on the older worker bees.
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked if glyphosate could be one of the reasons why Varroa mites are affecting honey bee populations in the U.S.,
      Shumway said, “Rationally, that would make since,” but there isn’t enough research on the issue yet.
      <br />
      <br />

      Varroa mites are parasitic mites that were brought into the U.S. from trade with Indonesia starting around 1987, Nancy
      Ruppert said, an apiary inspector for the North Carolina department of agriculture. These mites take nutrients away from
      the infected honey bee, which will end up killing them over time.
      <br />
      <br />

      Some apiary inspectors around North Carolina feel differently about Roundup being harmful to honey bees.
      <br />
      <br />

      “As far as I can tell, Roundup has no [effect] on honey bees and honey bee populations,” Adolphus Leonard said, another
      apiary inspector for the North Carolina department of agriculture. “It has been in widespread use in North Carolina for a
      very long time” and he hasn’t noticed any impact from using the product.
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked what he believes to be the largest threat to the honey bee populations, Leonard said, “Varroa mites and the
      diseases that they spread.”
      <br />
      <br />

      “There are 20 plus viruses that are spread by Varroa mites,” Leonard said. “So, that is the number one bee killer in North
      Carolina.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Some experts are even saying that there are flaws in the study.
      <br />
      <br />

      “If they are done in the lab, where they are holding the bees down and forcing [the chemical on them,] which is how most
      of these studies are done, they might get much different studies than when bees come across it in the field,” Jennifer
      Keller said, a research specialist in entomology and plant pathology at North Carolina State University.
      <br />
      <br />

      “You are not supposed to spray Roundup on flowers and plants that bees will be visiting,” Keller said. “So, if you are
      just spraying on grass and there are no flowers, there is no reason for the bees to even come in contact with it.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Overall, there is no definitive answer when it comes to honey bees being affected by glyphosate, Keller said.
