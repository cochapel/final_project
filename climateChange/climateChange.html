      <p>Chapel Hill, NC—Climate change could become a threat to bees around the world, especially in urban areas where
      temperatures can rise high enough to prevent them from reproducing.
      <br />
      <br />

      The main cause for urban warming comes from the sun baring down on asphalt and concrete during the day, which can absorb
      radiation and release a large amount of heat, Steve Frank said, a professor at North Carolina State University in
      entomology and plant pathology. There are around 500 species of bees in North Carolina, and although we don’t know
      exactly how many of the 500 species of bees can’t tolerate global warming, we do know that there are some.
      <br />
      <br />

      According to the study published in Urban Ecosystems, there are certain types of bees, such as carpenter bees, that are
      able to withstand higher temperatures.
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked why carpenter bees are able to withstand higher temperatures, Frank said, “Well, we don’t know exactly. They
      are larger for one thing…and just by being larger, their temperature is not going to increase as rapidly.”
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked if global warming is a larger issue than pesticide use for bees, Frank said, “No one knows the exact
      contributions of those factors, but global warming is important…but the whole world is not covered in pesticides, but
      most of the world is warming. So, global warming affects a larger area.”
      <br />
      <br />

      The number of bees that are killed off by pesticides is not a large percentage of the bee population, Nancy Ruppert said,
      an apiary inspector for the North Carolina department of agriculture.
      <br />
      <br />

      When asked if global warming has a large effect on bee populations, Ruppert said, “I don’t think we can really tell for
      sure, although there are so many organisms, including bees, that their schedules have been thrown off.”
      <br />
      <br />

      The reason that bees’ schedules are being thrown off for pollinating flowers is because spring has been occurring earlier,
      Ruppert said. This phenomenon is occurring more often because of global warming.
      <br />
      <br />

      “But it takes several years of that phenomenon to occur before you can really tell how it is affecting the bees,” Ruppert
      said.
      <br />
      <br />

      The effect of global warming on bee populations is possible, but there is no confirmation that directly proves that it is
      an issue at this time, Ruppert said.
      <br />
      <br />

      Fortunately, there are ways to help prevent urban warming by trying to cool surfaces, such as asphalt and concrete, Frank
      said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “In terms of urban warming, there’s ways to try and cool cities primarily by increasing the number of trees and reducing
      the amount of impervious surfaces,” Frank said. “Those surfaces absorb radiation from the sun and release it as heat.”
      <br />
      <br />

      If cities plant more trees, they could effectively reduce the number of surfaces being hit by the sun that are causing
      urban warming, Frank said. They could also replace surfaces with grass or mulch.
      <br />
      <br />

      Some cities around the world are attempting to cut down on urban warming by planting more trees, Frank said.
      <br />
      <br />

      “In New York, they have, I think what they call The Million Tree,” Frank said. “They have a goal of planting a million
      trees over a certain number of years.”
      <br />
      <br />

      Even the city of Raleigh is planning to increase the number of trees planted, Frank said. But there are problems when it
      comes to planting trees.
      <br />
      <br />

      “It takes a long time to get a big tree. So, even if you plant thousands of trees today, you’re not going to have big
      shade providing trees for 10, 20 or 30 years. It is just a slow process,” Frank said.
      <br />
      <br />

      Even though global warming is a rising concern around the world, bee experts still remain hopeful for the future of bee
      populations. It will just take time and resources for them to recover, Don Hopkins said, another apiary inspector for the
      North Carolina department of agriculture.
      <br />
      <br />

      “Beekeepers will succeed, but they’re going to have to put a greater investment of both time and resources into
      maintaining their colonies,” Hopkins said.
